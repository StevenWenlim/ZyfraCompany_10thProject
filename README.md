# ZyfraCompany_10thProject
This project is my 2nd integrated project for sprint 6 - 9.

In this srpint I am trying to apply all the knowledge that I have learned in Sprints 6 - 9.

# Project Overview
As a Data Scientist at Zyfra Company, i was asked to create a model that could predict the amount of gold that could be extracted from gold ore. There are data related to the extraction process and purification of gold ore that could help us to train a model. This model is expected to help create more efficient production process.

After analyzing and creating the model, the following is a summary of the project:

In this project, I created a model to predict the amount of gold that can be extracted from the available features. Here I create 3 models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ridge. Based on the analysis of 3 models, it was found that the Random Forest model performed better than other models. By using max_depth = 10, n_estimators = 200, max_features = 'log2' for the hyperparameter the model will result 7.655 for smape value on the test dataset.
